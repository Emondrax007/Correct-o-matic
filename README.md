# Correct-o-matic


This is a simple auto correct program that uses TextBlob to correct spelling errors in the text entered into the Input text box. The corrected text will then be displayed in the Output text box. The Clear button can be used to clear the text from both boxes.

To use the program, simply enter the text you want to correct into the Input text box and click the Correct button. The corrected text will then be displayed in the Output text box. You can use the Clear button to clear the text from both boxes at any time.

This program is a great way to improve your spelling and grammar. It can also be used to help you proofread your work before submitting it.
