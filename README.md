# Correct-o-matic
A simple Autocorrect tool.


This code will create a simple auto correct program that uses TextBlob to correct spelling errors in the text entered into the Input text box. The corrected text will then be displayed in the Output text box. The Clear button can be used to clear the text from both boxes.

Here is an example of how the program could be used:

Enter the text "I havv goood speling!" into the Input text box.
Click the Correct button.
The Output text box will display the corrected text "I have good spelling!".
Click the Clear button to clear both text boxes.
